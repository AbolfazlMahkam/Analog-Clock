# Analog-Clock

I designed a beautiful analog clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that displays the current time to the user.

After designing this clock, I noticed that its hands moved in a ticking motion, and I wanted to make it move smoothly, similar to some real clocks that work continuously without stopping.

At first, with the application of transitions, I noticed that with this movement, the hands fell behind the exact time, and before reaching 12 o'clock, they jumped backward and then started counting the next second.

After a lot of thinking and exploration, I managed to make the hands work as I wanted.

In the JS file, the initial code is commented so you can see the difference between the ticking state and the smooth movement when writing the program.
